// if we create a variable and can not declare a value then javascript give the output it is undefined

// CourseYear = "3rd Year" this is also correct because javascript allow to declare your variable without use a keyword but it is not good practice

MyName = "anmol" //This is Right because let have re declare and it have have a  block scope
CollegeName="arya"
// CollegeRollNumber = 22828 it can not re declare because it is a const variable it is a global scope
