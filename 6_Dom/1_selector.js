// innertext give the only text of a Element which is available
// innercontext it will give the hidden text also
//  innerhtml it will give the whole innerhtml of a element also a tag

// document.querySelectorAll it will give the node list which  little nature match  to the array
// but not all method of array is impliment on this node list if we use all method of array on node list then
// you will convert this to array by use of Array.from()

// document.getelementbyclass() it will give the html collection and we can not use any array method to html collection
// so we always convert this to array

// window is object , it is also known as as global object
// =>DOM
// In simple words, the DOM (Document Object Model) is a way for web browsers to understand and manage the content of a web page.

// When a web page loads, the browser turns the HTML code into a tree-like structure of objects, where each part of the page (like paragraphs, images, buttons, and links) becomes a node in this tree. JavaScript can then interact with this tree to change the content, style, or structure of the page without needing to reload it.

// So, the DOM is like a bridge between the HTML you write and what you see and interact with on the screen. ðŸ˜Š
