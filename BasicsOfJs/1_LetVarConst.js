const CollegeRollNumber = 22827
let MyName = "Kamal"
var CollegeName = "PIET"
// if we create hai variable and can not declare a value then javascript give the output it is undefined
// CourseYear = "3rd Year" this is also correct because javascript allow to declare your variable without use a keyword but it is not good practice

// CollegeName = "KUK" This is Right because let have re declare and it have hai block scope
// CollegeRollNumber = 22828 it can not re declare because it is a const variable it is a global scope



console.table([CollegeName , MyName , CollegeRollNumber , CourseYear])
